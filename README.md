# sample_project
This is not a complete project. It is just a sample showing the use of PHP
with the Box.com api and  the use of Javascript with JQuery inside the cakephp framework. 
The view_building.ctp view file and controller function is included. 
The main project is the digital vault project also knows as DiVa(not my name choice). 
It Matches all architectural drawings and schematics with the building on campus. 
It allows users to search for drawings by buildings and then share those documents 
with others via box.com.
